# Coding Style Guidelines

This document outlines the coding style and quality standards for the Node.js API Generator project, enforcing strict type safety and consistent code quality using ESLint and Prettier.

## Key Principles

- **Type Safety First**: Strict TypeScript configuration with no implicit any
- **Consistent Formatting**: Automated code formatting with Prettier
- **Code Quality**: ESLint rules for maintainable and readable code
- **Error Prevention**: Comprehensive linting to catch issues early
- **Performance**: Efficient patterns and best practices

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Template Structure Protection

**NEVER MODIFY EXISTING TEMPLATES WITHOUT EXPLICIT REQUEST**

The following template structures are PROTECTED and must NEVER be changed unless the user explicitly asks for template modifications:

### 🔒 Protected Template Files:
- `src/templates/crud.*.ts` - All CRUD operation templates
- `src/templates/custom.*.ts` - All custom API templates
- `src/templates/routes.templates.ts` - Route generation templates
- `src/templates/repository.templates.ts` - Repository templates
- `src/templates/*.tests.ts` - All test generation templates
- `src/templates/typed-*.ts` - All typed template files

### 🔒 Protected Template Patterns:
- **File naming conventions**: `operation.moduleName.ts` format
- **Directory structures**: Current folder organization in generated APIs
- **Test folder structure**: `tests/moduleName/operation/` pattern
- **Function parameter patterns**: Object destructuring `async({ params }: Type)`
- **Type definitions**: `typePayload`, `typeResult`, `typeResultData`, `typeResultError`
- **Import/export patterns**: Current module import/export structure

### 🚨 Template Modification Rules:
1. **NEVER** change template structure without explicit user request
2. **NEVER** modify existing template patterns or conventions
3. **NEVER** alter the generated file organization
4. **NEVER** change the established naming patterns
5. **ONLY** modify templates when user specifically asks: "change the template" or "modify the template structure"

### ✅ What IS Allowed:
- Bug fixes in template logic that don't change structure
- Adding new template options while preserving existing ones
- Improving template content quality without changing patterns
- Fixing TypeScript compilation errors in templates

### ❌ What is FORBIDDEN:
- Changing file naming patterns in templates
- Modifying directory structures in generated code
- Altering established function signatures in templates
- Changing import/export patterns without explicit request
- "Improving" or "optimizing" template structures unsolicited

## Development Tools

- **ESLint**: Code linting and quality enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting and style consistency
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking and compilation
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit quality checks
- **lint-staged**: Run linters on staged files only

## Before Writing Code

1. Analyze existing patterns in the codebase
2. Consider edge cases and error scenarios
3. Follow the TypeScript and linting rules strictly
4. Ensure proper error handling and validation
5. Use interfaces for all function parameters
6. Follow camelCase for files and kebab-case for directories

## Naming Conventions

### Generated File Naming Conventions

Generated files follow specific patterns that must be preserved:

- **Operation files**: `operation.moduleName.ts` (e.g., `create.user.ts`, `get.product.ts`)
- **Type files**: `operation.moduleName.ts` in `types/` directory
- **Validator files**: `operation.moduleName.ts` in `validators/` directory
- **Controller files**: `operation.moduleName.ts` in `controllers/` directory
- **Handler files**: `operation.moduleName.ts` in `handlers/` directory
- **Repository files**: `moduleName.repository.ts`
- **Route files**: `moduleName.routes.ts`

### Generated Directory Structure

```
src/apis/
└── {moduleName}/
    ├── controllers/
    ├── handlers/
    ├── repository/
    ├── types/
    ├── validators/
    └── {moduleName}.routes.ts

tests/
└── {moduleName}/
    ├── create/
    ├── get/
    ├── list/
    ├── update/
    ├── delete/
    └── shared/
```

## Generated Function Parameter Patterns

### Object Destructuring Parameters (Generated Pattern)

All generated functions use object destructuring for parameters:

```typescript
// ✅ Generated Pattern: Object destructuring in handlers
export default async function createUserHandler(
  payload: typePayload,
  requestId: string
): Promise<typeResult> {
  // Implementation
}

// ✅ Generated Pattern: Object destructuring in repository
export default async function create({
  name,
  email,
  password,
  role,
  is_active,
}: CreatePayload) {
  // Implementation
}

// ✅ Generated Pattern: Controllers with Express req/res
export default async function createUserController(req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> {
  // Implementation
}
```

**Note**: See `folder_structure.md` for detailed interface patterns and comprehensive service examples.

### Benefits of Interface-Based Parameters

- **Readability**: Clear parameter names at call site
- **Maintainability**: Easy to add/remove parameters without breaking changes
- **Type Safety**: Better TypeScript inference and validation
- **Documentation**: Self-documenting function signatures

## Rules

### API Response Standards

- Always return consistent response structures
- Include appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Use camelCase for JSON response fields
- Include request IDs for tracing when applicable

### Code Complexity and Quality

- Don't use consecutive spaces in regular expression literals.
- Don't use the `arguments` object.
- Don't use primitive type aliases or misleading types.
- Don't use the comma operator.
- Don't use empty type parameters in type aliases and interfaces.
- Don't write functions that exceed a given Cognitive Complexity score.
- Don't nest describe() blocks too deeply in test files.
- Don't use unnecessary boolean casts.
- Don't use unnecessary callbacks with flatMap.
- Use for...of statements instead of Array.forEach.
- Don't create classes that only have static members (like a static namespace).
- Don't use this and super in static contexts.
- Don't use unnecessary catch clauses.
- Don't use unnecessary constructors.
- Don't use unnecessary continue statements.
- Don't export empty modules that don't change anything.
- Don't use unnecessary escape sequences in regular expression literals.
- Don't use unnecessary fragments.
- Don't use unnecessary labels.

- Don't use unnecessary string or template literal concatenation.
- Don't use String.raw in template literals when there are no escape sequences.
- Don't use useless case statements in switch statements.
- Don't use ternary operators when simpler alternatives exist.
- Don't use useless `this` aliasing.
- Don't use any or unknown as type constraints.
- Don't initialize variables to undefined.
- Don't use the void operators (they're not familiar).
- Use arrow functions instead of function expressions.
- Use Date.now() to get milliseconds since the Unix Epoch.
- Use .flatMap() instead of map().flat() when possible.
- Use literal property access instead of computed property access.
- Don't use parseInt() or Number.parseInt() when binary, octal, or hexadecimal literals work.
- Use concise optional chaining instead of chained logical expressions.
- Use regular expression literals instead of the RegExp constructor when possible.
- Don't use number literal object member names that aren't base 10 or use underscore separators.
- Remove redundant terms from logical expressions.
- Use while loops instead of for loops when you don't need initializer and update expressions.

- Don't use empty destructuring patterns.
- Don't call global object properties as functions.
- Don't declare functions and vars that are accessible outside their block.
- Make sure builtins are correctly instantiated.
- Don't use super() incorrectly inside classes. Also check that super() is called in classes that extend other constructors.
- Don't use variables and function parameters before they're declared.
- Don't use 8 and 9 escape sequences in string literals.

- Set appropriate CORS headers for API endpoints
- Use body-parser or express.json() for parsing request bodies
- Implement request validation middleware before route handlers
- Use router instances for modular route organization
- Set security headers using helmet middleware
- Implement request logging with appropriate middleware

### Testing Best Practices

- Don't use export or module.exports in test files.
- Don't use focused tests.
- Make sure the assertion function, like expect, is placed inside an it() function call.
- Don't use disabled tests.

## Common Tasks

- `npx ultracite init` - Initialize Ultracite in your project
- `npx ultracite format` - Format and fix code automatically
- `npx ultracite lint` - Check for issues without fixing

## Example: Error Handling

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive error handling
try {
  const result = await fetchData();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API call failed:', error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}

// ❌ Bad: Swallowing errors
try {
  return await fetchData();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

# Folder Structure Guidelines

This document defines the comprehensive folder structure and organization patterns for the Node.js API Generator project, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.

## Core Architecture Principles

- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between controllers, handlers, and repository layers
- **Generated Structure**: Consistent organization for all generated API modules
- **Type-First Development**: TypeScript types drive code generation
- **Template-Based**: All code follows established template patterns
- **Framework Agnostic**: Business logic independent of web framework
